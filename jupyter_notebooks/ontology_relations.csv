../Ontologies/pmdco_core.ttl,https://w3id.org/pmd/co/Stress,Stress,subClassOf,https://w3id.org/pmd/co/ValueObject,Value Object,"A :ValueObject is a simple entity which represents a specific value. This value can be a numerical, textual, or a more complex data structure. If a literal value is to be specified, the :value datatype property has to be used. In cases where the value is represented by a resource (e.g. URI), the :resource object property has to be used.

A value object, respectively its value, is always associated with an entity of type :Process, :ProcessingNode, or :Object (e.g. :Specimen). The value is meant to be a charactaristic of the associated entity. To express this association it is indended to use the :participant object property.

A value object might also refer to a certain unit. The :unit property might be used (e.g. with QUDT ontology).

Instances of a value object might be specified as a specific Parameter, namely a SetPoint (nominal value), or Measurement. With :Setpoint the intend is to express, that the value is meant to be some preset, setting or nominal value. :Measurement expresses, that the value has been measured or determined somehow (see example).

Instances of a value object might also be specified in a specific DataScope (:Metadata, :PrimaryData, :SecondaryData)."
