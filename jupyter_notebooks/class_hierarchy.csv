https://w3id.org/pmd/co/TensileTest,Tensile Test,"Tensile tests (tension tests) on materials provide information on their strength, ductility as well as other characteristic values under uniaxial tensile stress. The tensile test involves straining a test piece by tensile force, generally to fracture, for the determination of one or more mechanical properties specified by the semantically related and defined terms.",subClassOf,https://w3id.org/pmd/co/MechanicalTestingProcess,Mechanical Testing Process,Determinization of a mechanical property.,../Ontologies/pmdco_core.ttl

In PMD, a process is conducted via processing nodes and has a discernable duration as part of a workflow. A process consumes objects and parameters. A process potentially generates new objects and measurements. A process is either a transformative process or a non-transformative process with respect to objects processed via a processing node. There are primarily two types of distinguishable processes: manufacture process, analysis process. A process is a series of operations that are subordinate processes.",../Ontologies/materialsmine_converted.ttl
