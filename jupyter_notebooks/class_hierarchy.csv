ISO 80000-1 Measured or simulated 'physical propertiy'-s are always defined by a physical law, connected to a physical entity through a model perspective and measurement is done according to the same model.

Systems of units suggests that this is the correct approach, since except for the fundamental units (length, time, charge) every other unit is derived by mathematical relations between these fundamental units, implying a physical laws or definitions. Measurement units of quantities of the same quantity dimension may be designated by the same name and symbol even when the quantities are not of the same kind.

For example, joule per kelvin and J/K are respectively the name and symbol of both a measurement unit of heat capacity and a measurement unit of entropy, which are generally not considered to be quantities of the same kind.

However, in some cases special measurement unit names are restricted to be used with quantities of specific kind only.

For example, the measurement unit ‘second to the power minus one’ (1/s) is called hertz (Hz) when used for frequencies and becquerel (Bq) when used for activities of radionuclides.

As another example, the joule (J) is used as a unit of energy, but never as a unit of moment of force, i.e. the newton metre (N · m). — quantities of the same kind have the same quantity dimension,
— quantities of different quantity dimensions are always of different kinds, and
— quantities having the same quantity dimension are not necessarily of the same kind.
