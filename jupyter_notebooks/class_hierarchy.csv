In PMD, a process is conducted via processing nodes and has a discernable duration as part of a workflow. A process consumes objects and parameters. A process potentially generates new objects and measurements. A process is either a transformative process or a non-transformative process with respect to objects processed via a processing node. There are primarily two types of distinguishable processes: manufacture process, analysis process. A process is a series of operations that are subordinate processes.",subClassOf,http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity,,,../Ontologies/materialsmine_converted.ttl
