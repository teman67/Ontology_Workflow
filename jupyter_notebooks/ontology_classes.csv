../Ontologies/pmdco_core.ttl,https://w3id.org/pmd/co/TensileTest,Tensile Test,"Tensile tests (tension tests) on materials provide information on their strength, ductility as well as other characteristic values under uniaxial tensile stress. The tensile test involves straining a test piece by tensile force, generally to fracture, for the determination of one or more mechanical properties specified by the semantically related and defined terms."
