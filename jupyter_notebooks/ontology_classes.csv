http://materialsmine.org/ns/Particle,Particle,"particles between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. In nanotechnology, a particle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit with respect to its transport and properties."
http://materialsmine.org/ns/Stress,Stress,"When a material is loaded with a force, it produces a stress, which then causes a material to deform. "
http://materialsmine.org/ns/Strain,Strain,Engineering strain is defined as the amount of deformation in the direction of the applied force divided by the initial length of the material.
http://materialsmine.org/ns/MechanicalProperty,Mechanical Property,A materials property related to the response of a material under some external applied load.
